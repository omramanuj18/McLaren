      "An extreme McLaren design concept born in the virtual racing world.Now made real. And ultra-rare. There will only ever be 25 Solus GTs. Rendered possible through McLaren's position at the apex of motorsport, supercar and hypercar development – this is a pure expression of track driving focus and engagement. A single seater. With central closed cockpit and jet aircraft-style canopy. A ground-up design set free from the compromises of road and race regulations. The unique monocoque houses a naturally aspirated 5.2 litre V10 engine that revs beyond 10,000rpm and generates more than 840PS. In a ruthlessly pared down machine that weighs less than 1,000kg and generates 1,200kg of downforce. It's as close to the experience and feel of driving a Formula 1 car as you can get.",
